## Drone Simulator Project

--First Deliverable--

Oisin Perkins-Gilbert: The biggest issue I've had with this project has been trying to find the time to fit 10 hours of project work. I think the most difficult class I had to implement was the one that checks for teleportation, as I had to brush up on my physics and use actual formulas. Making JUnit tests also took a very long time, and probably accounted for half if not more of the time I spent developing this.


James Escudero: For this first iteration, it was quite new and confusing. I would say most of my difficulty was actually creating the user stores and doing all the required tasks we needed to do with youtrack. After doing this first iteration, I'm still a bit unsure about creating user stories in itself. Moving on to the development side of our project, there wasn't any huge headache to it. I just develop the very basic and bare bone of 3 classes that we have. I had all the classes off the UML, which was quite helpful.
