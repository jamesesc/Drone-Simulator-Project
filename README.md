## Drone Simulator Project

--First Deliverable--
Oisin Perkins-Gilbert: The biggest issue I've had with this project has been trying to find the time to fit 10 hours of project work. I think the most difficult class I had to implement was the one that checks for teleportation, as I had to brush up on my physics and use actual formulas. Making JUnit tests also took a very long time, and probably accounted for half if not more of the time I spent developing this.
