--Fourth Deliverable--

James Escudero:

Mankirat Mann: I think the most difficult part this week was dealing with dependency and Jdbc driver issues. For some reason I had to re add the things into the project. But overall things went smoothly after.



--Third Deliverable--

Oisin Perkins-Gilbert: I'd say the most difficult thing about this week's deliverable has been having to go back and fix something I thought I already finished, or make it better and more efficient. I'd often do something one way, then find another way to do it a different way, and pray that it wouldn't cause any bugs trying to make it work.

James Escudero: For this third deliverable, the only issues that I want to discuss my team is the whole idea of 
what data should droneMonitor be sending over to the front end. Additionally, im curious if it is okay for the front end 
to use the drone methods like getBattery, or even the telemetry getters method. Moreover, this deliverable for me was 
mostly progressing more on connecting the frontend to the backend (droneMonitor). This is especially true as I 
refactored and implemented more structure in the droneMonitor to handle the overall logic for the simulation.

Mankirat Mann:

--Second Deliverable--

Oisin Perkins-Gilbert: Still, the biggest issue I've had with this project has been fitting in the time to do it,
as I've had Halloween plans, my job, and other classes during the time I could've spent working on this. Besides that,
most of this deliverable has been spent with me googling how to do things in JavaFX, going through documentation and
stack overflow forums.

James Escudero: For this 2nd iteration, there wasn't any major issues. The only thing that we needed as a team to 
discuss is just the technical procedures and structure of how we want our drone to operate in the simulation, 
particularly like the telemetry generator. Additionally, I was able to figure out this long and painful issue in 
developing a realistic velocity generator. In a very simple and short form, I was able to design where we take 
account of the current drone velocity, where the velocity closer to the original would have a higher chance to be 
generated than the ones that's like +50 away.

Mankirat Mann: For this second deliverable, I worked on learning the basics of JavaFX to get ready for building the
drone project’s user interface. I also looked into Scene Builder and FXML to see how design and code work together. 
This week was really busy with other classes and other personal things, so I didn’t have much time, but I still learned 
more about how to make the UI interactive for next time.


--First Deliverable--

Oisin Perkins-Gilbert: The biggest issue I've had with this project has been trying to find the time to fit 10 hours 
of project work. I think the most difficult class I had to implement was the one that checks for teleportation, as I
had to brush up on my physics and use actual formulas. Making JUnit tests also took a very long time, and probably 
accounted for half if not more of the time I spent developing this.


James Escudero: For this first iteration, it was quite new and confusing. I would say most of my difficulty was 
actually creating the user stores and doing all the required tasks we needed to do with youtrack. After doing this 
first iteration, I'm still a bit unsure about creating user stories in itself. Moving on to the development side of
our project, there wasn't any huge headache to it. I just develop the very basic and bare bone of 3 classes that we
have. I had all the classes off the UML, which was quite helpful. 

Mankirat Mann: For this iteration, my main issue was setting up the sqlite database for storing the drone anomalies. 
I spent a good amount of time troubleshooting the JDBC driver in IntelliJ and I had issues with putting the jar file
in IntelliJ. And learning the SQL syntax was a little confusing at first because I had only done it on Python before,
but I am slowly getting used to it.
